# CareFlowTest

Has 3 Activities
1. Splash Activity: Here I am getting auth token from the api and after getting response user Will go to Patient list screen.
2. PatientListActivity: It has a Fragment
	
	a). PatientListFragment: It will show list of patient that comes from API.
3. PatientDetailActivity: It has a Fragment to show detail
	
	a). PatientDetailFragment: It will show patient detail:
  
  Note: As API was not working, This code is not tested. I don't know the response structure for Patient API so the list and Patient detail 
  is not complete.
  Models for PatientDetails are empty.
